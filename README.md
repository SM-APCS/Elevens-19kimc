3.Create ranks, suits, and pointValues of length 52. Ranks contains 4 1's, 4 2's, 4 3's, ..., up to 4 Ace's. Suits contains 13 hearts, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, and 13 clubs. pointValues contains 4 1's, 4 2's, 4 3's, ..., 16 10's, and 4 11's.
4.Yes, because the nth index of all the arrays are part of one card.

5♣ 6♣
2) Yes because every time two cards are removed unless if it is a J, Q, and K. Thus, the amount of cards remaining on the board without there being a full J, Q, and K set must always be an even number, otherwise there is a full J, Q, and K.

3) This game does not involve any strategy since none of the pairs of cards that add to eleven overlap, thus it is pure luck based on which cards are drawn everytime one replaces a pair.
